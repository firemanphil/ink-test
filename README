I've provided two scripts and a set of tests:

==========================
berlin_clock.py
=========================

Running this provides a berlin clock string representation of the current time
every second. If you specify a time, it will print the berlin clock
representation of that time then quit. The syntax is like this:

./berlin_clock.py 23:12:12

for example

==========================
berlin_clock_colours.py
==========================

This has the same functionality as the above script but gives a visual
representation of the lights. It requires the module termcolor which is
available via pip:

pip install termcolor

==========================
test_berlin_clock.py
==========================

Some tests to check that everything works as expected. Run like this:

python -m unittest -v test_berlin_clock
